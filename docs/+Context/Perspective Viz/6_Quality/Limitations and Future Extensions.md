### When the System Struggles

- **Ultra‑high dimensional problems**  
    Grids beyond 1 k criteria become visually dense.  
    – planned fix: dynamic topic clustering and auto‑pagination
    
- **Real‑time crisis decisions**  
    In a fast‑moving disaster, Explain‑Back prompts may feel slow.  
    – quick mode drops full rationale requirement, stores voice memo asynchronously
    
- **Deep cultural or religious axioms**  
    No evidence can sway a value that is axiomatic.  
    – perspective distance map surfaces irreducible gaps; facilitators switch to negotiated coexistence instead of consensus
    
- **Synthetic media floods**  
    Even with forgery detectors, volume can overwhelm reviewers.  
    – roadmap: integrate third‑party zero‑knowledge proof services and stake‑weighted evidence up‑ranking
    
- **Accessibility overload**  
    Too many visual cues can confuse first‑time screen‑reader users.  
    – upcoming text‑first linear narrative mode that collapses all visuals into a plain markdown trace

- **Moral-foundation mis-labeling** 
	LLM heuristics can project wrong values; roadmap: crowd-sourced re-tagging + confidence interval display.  

- **Perspective alias drift** 
	Synonyms mapped today may diverge tomorrow; roadmap: nightly LLM alias audit & human review queue.
    
- **Privacy in Authoritarian Contexts**  
    Local data storage may still be seized.  
    – optional onion‑routed sync and client‑side encryption with plausible‑deniability decoy vaults
    
    

### Near‑Term Build Targets

- ontology workbench public alpha
    
- mobile glance view (Tier 0 chip) with offline cache
    
- definition lens clustering for top 20 ambiguous terms
    
- zero‑knowledge evidence authenticity prototype
