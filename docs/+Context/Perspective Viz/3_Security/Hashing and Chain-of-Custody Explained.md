###  **Playground Version**

#### 1. Digital Fingerprints

- Imagine every report or spreadsheet is a **Lego tower**.
    
- We run it through a _magic stamping machine_ called a **hash**.
    
- The machine spits out a super-long number (like “A7F3…”)—that’s its **fingerprint**.
    
- **One tiny change** (even swapping a single Lego brick) makes a brand-new fingerprint.
    
    - So if the number you expect doesn’t match the number you get, you know someone messed with the tower.
        

#### 2. The Sticker Book (Ledger)

- As soon as the tower gets its fingerprint, we **write that number in a sticker book** next to “Owner: Abby, Time: 2:15 pm”.
    
- When Abby passes the tower to Ben, Ben checks the tower’s fingerprint:
    
    - If it’s **exactly the same**, he adds “Ben, 2:30 pm” on the next line.
        
    - If it’s **different**, the book shows a red ❗ so everyone sees something’s fishy.
        

#### 3. Probable-Fake Overlay (Big Red Flag)

- In the app, that red ❗ becomes a **ghosty red mask** over the data card.
    
- It doesn’t delete the card—it just yells, “Hey, don’t trust this until someone fixes or explains it!”
    

#### 4. Credibility Meter (Gold Stars)

- Think of a **star chart** your teacher uses.
    
    - A peer-reviewed science paper gets **4–5 gold stars**.
        
    - A story from “my friend’s cousin” gets **1 wobbly star**.
        
- The stars help everyone decide how heavy a Lego tower should be when we build decisions.
    

#### 5. Weight-Spam Log (Slow-Down Button)

- If someone tries to slap **hundreds of flimsy towers** onto the table super fast, the app hits a **slow-down button**.
    
    - It’s like the teacher saying, “One at a time, please,” so the room doesn’t fill with junk towers.

#### Why It Matters

- **Fingerprint + Sticker Book** → We can always prove _what_ changed and _who_ changed it.
    
- **Red Masks** → Shouts “double-check me!” before bad info sneaks into the plan.
    
- **Gold Stars** → Make sure strong evidence weighs more than playground rumors.
    
- **Slow-Down Button** → Stops sneaky kids from burying good info under a pile of nonsense.
    

Put together, the system keeps our bridge-repair plan **honest, clear, and fair**—even for grown-ups who still act like kids sometimes.
