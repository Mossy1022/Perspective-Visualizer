Definition Lens ships in MVP; Ontology Workbench full API is Phase 3
## Core‑Concept Library
- JSON file of canonical terms, id → definition → nuance sliders  
- governed by pull requests; versioned releases tagged semver  
- educators can pin a library snapshot for an assignment

## Definition Lens UX
- amber border marks an undefined term  
- click opens side panel with  
  - definition text  
  - spectrum slider (e.g. freedom ←→ economic)  
  - mini‑map preview showing weight ripple  
- saving locks the term and clears the amber glow

## Semantic Diff View
Comparing two perspectives collapses rows into term buckets; a split‑cell animation surfaces hidden divergence.

## Context Breadcrumbs
Sticky header lists active definition, timestamp, mood, role; shows why a term changed meaning over time.
