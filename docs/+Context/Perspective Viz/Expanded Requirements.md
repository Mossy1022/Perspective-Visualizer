### Decision‑Visualizer — Requirements & UX Blueprint v2.0

_(Concise brainstorm: bolt‑on upgrades to your current spec, with loophole plugs and an intuitive → power‑user glide‑path.)_

---
## 1. Expanded **Requirements**

|Layer|New Capability|Rationale / “Great‑Awakening” Tie‑In|
|---|---|---|
|**Perspective Capture**|• AI‑assisted **“Intent Parser”** converts free‑text (“freedom”) into one or more _dimension tags_ (e.g., _negative‑liberty_, _economic‑freedom_, _time‑autonomy_) and asks the author to confirm / split.|Forces early disambiguation; speeds later visual comparisons.|
||• **Context Snapshot** auto‑records author’s locale, time‑pressure, mood & declared role (“citizen”, “exec”) for future empathy replay.|When personal data leaks, viewers can see _why_ that view existed instead of judging it ahistorically.|
|**Semantics & Ontology**|• Curated **Core‑Concept Library** (≈500 cross‑disciplinary terms) shipped with canonical definitions + sliders for nuance. Community can fork or extend libraries per domain.|Prevents two users arguing over different meanings of the same word.|
|**Reasoning Engine**|• **Rule Guardrails**: weight can’t be saved if (credibility × confidence) < threshold. • **Weight‑Spam Throttle**: detects >X edits/min by one user → flags for review.|Blocks “drive‑by” narrative stuffing; thwarts coordinated attacks.|
|**Evidence Layer**|• **Chain‑of‑Custody Hash** stored per evidence file. • Built‑in optical + audio forgery detector APIs with “probable fake” overlay.|Mitigates synthetic‑media floods after a data‑dump moment.|
|**Collaboration / Governance**|• **Perspective Reputation Score** (blend of peer endorsements, prediction accuracy, and explain‑back quality). • **Fork‑merge Request flow** modelled after Git → every public change gets peer review.|Turns chaos into traceable, rate‑limited edits; good actors bubble up.|
|**Privacy & Resilience**|• End‑to‑end‑encrypted _local view_; user chooses when to publish. • **Self‑hosting option** for activists / enterprises.|Users keep agency even if the “awakening” drops raw data online.|
|**Analytics & Metrics**|• **Stress‑Scenario Simulator**: pick a leaked dataset → observe which criteria explode (large swings) vs stay stable. • **Perspective‑Distance Trend** over time → monitor polarization.|Quantifies societal shock absorption after mass info release.|

## 2. **UI / UX System** — Progressive Disclosure

|Tier|Audience|Screen Metaphor|Key Widgets|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Tier 0 — Glance**|Social media scrollers|_Perspective Chip_|Emoji + stance title + 3‑bar impact icon. Tap → Tier 1.|
|**Tier 1 — Novice**|First‑time users, classrooms|_Card Stack_|Entry‑level Perspective Card (already specced) + _Definition Lens_ toggle that shades ambiguous terms in amber and opens mini‑definition sliders.|
|**Tier 2 — Explorer**|Product teams, debate clubs|_Infinite Canvas_|Choice‑Criteria Heat‑Map (collapsible), Causal‑Loop overlay, Contradiction Pulse, Evidence hover cards.|
|**Tier 3 — Analyst**|Mediators, research|_Debug Console_|Monte‑Carlo panel, scenario dial, snapshot diff viewer, weight‑spam log, bot‑likelihood overlay, API export.|
|**Tier 4 — Builder**|Power users, AI devs|_Ontology Workbench_|Term library editor, custom badge creator, plug‑in SDK (Python/Rust), governance rule editor.|

Progression rule‑of‑thumb: _Every new tier appears only after the user has interacted with ≥70 % of the current tier’s core widgets at least once._ This keeps the first‑five‑minute experience frictionless while leaving headroom for mastery.

## 3. **Visualizing Ambiguous Criteria**

1. **Definition Lens (toggle)**
    
    - Amber border on any term lacking a canonical definition.
        
    - Tap/hover ⇒ side‑panel with:
        
        - Spectrum slider (e.g., “freedom” ←— personal | civil | economic | political —→)
            
        - Linked mini‑maps showing how each definition shifts current cell weights.
            
2. **Semantic Diff View**
    
    - Compare two perspectives → rows collapse into “term buckets.” Cells split if the underlying definition differs. A _split‑cell_ animation makes hidden divergence visceral.
        
3. **Context Breadcrumbs**
    
    - Sticky header shows active definition + timestamp + mood + role icons; instantly signals _why_ “freedom” today ≠ “freedom” last week.

## 4. **Loopholes & Mitigations**

|Vulnerability|Risk|Patch|
|---|---|---|
|**Ambiguity Gaming** (“I’ll keep it vague so no one spots contradictions.”)|Hidden disagreements, later bait‑and‑switch.|Mandatory definition picklist or text definition before a weight > 0 is allowed.|
|**Weight Flooding**|Attackers add 10k thin‑evidence weights to drown signal.|Throttle + reputation cost per new criterion; Monte‑Carlo auto‑down‑weights low‑credibility clusters.|
|**Mass Identity Doxxing** (post‑awakening)|Exposure of sensitive context metadata.|“Context Breadcrumbs” visible only to users inside the same trust circle by default; public views show anonymised tags.|
|**Groupthink Visualization Bias**|Users may trust bright consensus colour over their own judgment.|Add _Uncertainty Glare_: consensus cells with low evidence glow foggy, visually separating “popular” from “well‑supported.”|
|**Tool Complexity Paralysis** for newbies.|High churn.|Tiered UI, onboarding quests, and an _assistive walk‑through_ that uses the Explain‑Back prompt as micro‑tutorials.|

---

## 5. **Progressive‑Advanced Options**

- **Sandbox Replay**: clone any public perspective into a private sandbox; toggle hypothetical shocks (data leaks, regime change, new research) and export a GIF of the ripple animation.
    
- **Personal Accuracy Tracker**: opt‑in badge that charts how often _your_ past weightings matched reality after new evidence. Private by default—gamifies intellectual humility.
    
- **Emotional Gradient Overlay**: crowd‑sourced sentiment (fear → joy) per criterion; shows how identical facts evoke different feelings. Helps groups prep for emotionally‑charged disagreements.

## 6. **How the System Handles a “Great Awakening” Event**

1. **Bulk‑Import Wizard** ingests dumped emails / messages → auto‑tags criteria mentioned, scores credibility, and time‑stamps them.
    
2. **Shock Dashboard** highlights spikes in contradiction count, evidence volume and perspective distance.
    
3. **Adaptive Privacy Net**: users receive a _Red Alert_ banner if their private snapshots include leaked personal identifiers, prompting one‑click obfuscation or withdrawal.
    
4. **Collective Healing Mode**: a facilitator can start a _Bridge Exercise Marathon_ that algorithmically pairs the most distant sub‑clusters, with definition lenses locked open to foreground human commonalities.
    

---

## 7. **Immediate Build Next‑Steps**

1. **Prototype the Definition Lens** with 5‑term ontology and amber highlights.
    
2. Launch **Weight‑Spam Log** and **Explain‑Back Check** as MVP anti‑manipulation guards.
    
3. Instrument **Tier Progress Tracker** to validate onboarding friction assumptions.
    
4. Draft **Ontology Contribution Guidelines** (licence, review cadence).
    
5. Parallel‑track **Self‑Hosting Vault** spec (Docker + local‑first sync) for resilience.

### Bottom Line

By tightening semantic precision, hardening governance, and layering the interface like a game that unlocks depth only when you’re ready, the visualizer evolves from a clever argument map into a **societal shock‑absorber**. Whether tomorrow brings orderly debates or a globe‑wide data exposé, users will have the cognitive flight‑deck they need to **see** hidden assumptions, **simulate** consequences, and **steer** toward sane outcomes—together.
