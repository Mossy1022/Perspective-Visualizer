### Competitive Landscape (mid‑2025)

|Platform|Core purpose & model|Key strengths|Major gaps vs. **Perspective Visualizer**|Net comparative verdict|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Kialo / Kialo Edu**|Tree‑style _pro/con_ argument mapping for class & public debates. Freemium SaaS (not open‑source).|• Simple visual map • Large existing user base in schools • Anonymous mode for shy students ([Kialo](https://www.kialo-edu.com/ "Kialo Edu: The free tool for thoughtful, inclusive class discussion"))|• One dimension only (support vs. oppose) – no numeric weights, no confidence, no evidence quality meter. • No simulation, no Monte‑Carlo, no fork/merge workflow, no chain‑of‑custody.|**Visualizer ≫ Kialo** on analytical depth, evidence scrutiny, what‑if testing, and auditability. Kialo wins on low learning curve.|
|**Polis** (Computational Democracy)|Real‑time crowdsourcing & clustering of <140‑char statements to surface consensus; AGPL open source. ([compdemocracy.org](https://compdemocracy.org/polis/ "The Computational Democracy Project \| The Computational Democracy Project"))|• Handles tens‑of‑thousands of participants. • ML clustering reveals emergent “common ground” statements.|• Captures _opinions_, not _reasoning_: no criteria weights, no causal links, no evidence attachments. • No individual audit trail; statements are ephemeral votes.|**Visualizer ≫ Polis** for structured reasoning, evidence tracing, and simulation; Polis still unmatched for rapid, large‑scale sentiment triage.|
|**Decision Lens**|Enterprise multi‑criteria decision‑analysis (MCDA) / portfolio‑prioritisation SaaS for US government. Proprietary. ([decisionlens.com](https://www.decisionlens.com/ "Decision Lens \| Modernizing Government Planning & Budgeting"))|• Mature AHP‑style weighting and scenario planning. • Integrates budgets & schedules.|• Closed black‑box scoring; evidence & rationale often live outside the tool. • No public fork/PR or reputation layer; limited transparency. • License cost > $100 k/yr typical.|**Visualizer ≫ Decision Lens** on openness, provenance, and collaborative transparency; Decision Lens ahead today on built‑in budget & resource modules.|
|**Loomio**|Open‑source discussion + consent/consensus polling. Text threads, votes, and decision archive. ([loomio.com](https://www.loomio.com/ "Loomio - make decisions together without meetings"))|• Flexible templates for boards, co‑ops. • Clear decision log.|• No argument structure; rationale buried in comment scroll. • No per‑criterion weighting, evidence grading, or simulation.|**Visualizer ≫ Loomio** for critical‑thinking depth and bias detection; Loomio wins on simplicity for informal groups.|
|**DebateGraph**|Wiki‑style concept/argument maps; CC‑BY‑SA; browser graph UI. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debategraph?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Debategraph"))|• Fully open content; long history of policy use (White House, UK FCO).|• Manual node editing only – no AI capture, no evidence scoring, no simulation, no governance features for scale. UI dated.|**Visualizer ≫ DebateGraph** on usability, guard‑rails, and analytics; DebateGraph remains a lightweight, free alternative for static issue maps.|
|**Analytica** (Lumina)|Visual influence‑diagram modelling & Monte‑Carlo risk analysis (desktop). ([Analytica - Visionary Modeling](https://analytica.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Analytica - visionary modeling"))|• Powerful stochastic modelling engine.|• Steep learning curve; single‑user licences; no collaborative forks, no evidence‑credibility layer, no emotional/context cues.|**Visualizer ≫ Analytica** for collaboration and transparency; Analytica still excels for deep quantitative modelling in expert hands.|

### Where the Perspective Visualizer Outperforms

1. **Multi‑dimensional reasoning** – Nine visual dimensions (criteria weight, evidence strength, confidence, emotion, causality, time, forks, governance, simulation) versus single‑dimension trees or comment threads in rivals.
    
2. **Provenance & tamper‑evidence** – SHA‑256 hashes and a Git‑style merge ledger; none of the above competitors validate evidence integrity or sign snapshots.
    
3. **AI‑assisted capture + guard‑rails** – Intent‑parser auto‑builds the grid; Explain‑Back check forces rationale; Weight‑Spam log throttles abuse. Competitors rely mostly on manual input and moderation.
    
4. **Quantified “what‑if” analysis** – Integrated Monte‑Carlo & stress‑scenario simulator; only Analytica and (to a lesser extent) Decision Lens offer comparable numeric simulation, but without collaborative argument mapping.
    
5. **Open, forkable governance** – MIT‑licensed JSON schema + reputation badges + bot‑likelihood overlay; Kialo, Decision Lens, and Analytica are closed; Loomio & Polis are open but lack reputation or bot‑detection metrics.

### Edge Cases Where Competitors Still Shine

- **Mass‑participation polling**: Polis clusters 100 k+ citizens effortlessly; Visualizer’s Phase‑1 UI is tuned for teams to ~500 participants.
    
- **Budget/schedule integration**: Decision Lens owns the niche of detailed portfolio funding workflows inside US federal agencies.
    
- **Hard‑core quantitative risk modelling**: Analytica’s influence‑diagram engine remains deeper for specialists needing custom probability distributions and continuous variables.

### Overall Comparative Ranking (practical complexity handled per hour of facilitator time)

1. **Perspective Visualizer (Phase 1+)** – _5/5_ breadth × rigor balance
    
2. Decision Lens – _4/5_ on quantitative MCDA, but opaque & costly
    
3. Kialo – _3/5_ for classroom debates; low setup effort, limited depth
    
4. Polis – _3/5_ for mass consensus pulse‑taking; not for evidence reasoning
    
5. Loomio – _2.5/5_ for asynchronous consent; thin analytical layer
    
6. DebateGraph / Argunet – _2/5_ archival mapping; dated UX, manual entry
    
7. Analytica – _(niche)_ specialist quantitative modelling, poor collab UX
    

**Bottom line:** No existing platform combines _argument capture_, _evidence grading_, _bias/contradiction surfacing_, _real‑time simulation_, and _tamper‑evident governance_ in one seamless workflow. The Perspective Visualizer therefore occupies an uncontested “all‑in‑one critical‑thinking IDE” space—leap‑frogging point‑solutions that each solve only a slice of the reasoning challenge.
