_(Leverages **only** Phase 1 – MVP capabilities of the Perspective Visualizer)_

|Element|Why this scenario is widely acceptable|
|---|---|
|**Context**|A routine statewide inspection reveals **117 aging bridges** with structural scores below the safety threshold. Budget allows full repairs on only **40** this fiscal year.|
|**Mandate**|Within **72 hours**, a multi‑stakeholder task‑force must publish a **rank‑ordered repair slate** that is technically sound, economically justified, and publicly transparent.|
|**Stakeholders (Agents)**|• State DOT Bridge Engineering Division • County Public‑Works Directors • Trucking & Freight Council • Commuter Association • Environmental Watershed NGOs • State Budget Office|

## 0 | Spin‑Up (≤ 30 min)

1. **Local‑first Vault + Docker‑Self‑Host**   
    IT deploys the container on the DOT intranet—no sensitive inspection data ever leaves.
    
2. **Seed Capture via AI Intent Parser**   
    Each stakeholder uploads a two‑page brief; the parser extracts **criteria** such as  
    _structural risk, average daily traffic, detour cost, economic throughput, ecological sensitivity, equity score, projected repair cost._  
    The initial **Choice‑Criteria Heat‑Map** scaffold appears; manual spot‑check confirms ≥ 80 % extraction accuracy (MVP KPI).

## 1 | Definition Alignment (35 min)

- Terms like “**equity score**” and “**economic throughput**” glow amber under **Definition Lens**.
    
- Side‑panel consensus definitions are locked in; amber clears.
    
- **Explain‑Back Check** requires each team lead to type a one‑sentence justification before committing—capturing intent and preventing silent divergence.

## 2 | Evidence Layering (75 min)

|MVP Feature|Real‑time Illustration|
|---|---|
|**Evidence Card + Credibility Meter**|• FHWA load‑rating dataset (peer‑reviewed, cred‑meter = 0.95).• Citizen‑submitted photo reports (anecdotal, cred‑meter = 0.25).|
|**Chain‑of‑Custody Hash**|Hash mismatch on one county spreadsheet triggers **Probable‑Fake Overlay**; file is quarantined until re‑signed.|
|**Weight‑Spam Log**|Flags a Freight Council editor who pastes 60 low‑cred anecdotes in 10 min; rate‑limit auto‑throttles.|
|**Contradiction Pulse**|A bridge with low traffic but high economic‑throughput claim blinks—DOT data contradicts freight anecdote. After Explain‑Back, weight is reduced.|

## 3 | Negotiation & Bridging (85 min)

1. **Bridge Lens**
    
    - Sliders show that assigning **5 % discretionary funds** for rural detour‑length mitigation aligns County Directors with Budget Office thresholds.
        
2. **Confidence Halo**
    
    - Engineering Division has high confidence on _structural risk_ weights; NGOs’ confidence is lower on _ecological sensitivity_ for three bridges—spotlighting areas needing evidence.
        
3. **Perspective‑Distance Trend (basic)**
    
    - Cosine distance between DOT and NGOs drops from 0.68 → 0.34 after two bridge sessions—quantified convergence without Phase‑2 ribbons.

## 4 | Robustness Testing (30 min)

1. **Monte‑Carlo Outcome Panel**
    
    - 10 000 runs vary _steel price ± 20 %_ and _rainy‑season delay ± 15 days._
        
    - Current slate exceeds budget in 22 % of runs.
        
2. **Stress‑Scenario Simulator**
    
    - Slider adds “100‑year flood” to three river‑crossing bridges; slate adjustment (swap two low‑risk urban overpasses with one high‑risk rural span) reduces overspend risk to 6 %.
        
    - Snapshot + Explain‑Back commit rationale.

## 5 | Governance & Merge (20 min)

|Step|Phase‑1 Governance Feature|
|---|---|
|**Forks**|County coalition forks canvas to add _school‑bus route disruption_ criterion.|
|**Pull‑Request Overlay**|Diff viewer bundles new column + minor weight tweaks.|
|**Reputation Star**|Coalition editor has 4.3 ★; reviewers green‑light merge in 18 min (meets < 24 h KPI).|
|**License Badges**|Canvas is MIT‑licensed; individual counties can fork plan for their newsletters.|
|**Merge Commit**|Signed by all agents; branch‑timeline logs “Repair‑Slate‑v1.0 → Governor’s Desk.”|

---

## 6 | Outcome & Impact

|KPI or Outcome (Phase‑1 spec)|Achieved|
|---|---|
|**Decision latency**|Typical 3‑month budgeting cycle ➜ **9 h 40 m** total.|
|**Empathy score**|81 % of participants could restate their top opposing criterion.|
|**Unsourced weight commits**|**1.1 %** (below 3 % guard‑rail).|
|**Time‑to‑first Monte‑Carlo**|**1.3 s** (≤ 2 s KPI).|
|**Contradictions resolved**|89 % before final merge.|
|**Public‑facing deliverable**|Tier‑0 chip summary embedded on DOT site; public comment period opened same day.|

### Why This Scenario Works Perfectly for MVP

1. **Neutral & Concrete** – Bridge safety is universally valued, avoids polarizing topics.
    
2. **Complex Trade‑offs** – Balances engineering risk, economics, ecology, and equity—ideal for the **Choice‑Criteria Heat‑Map** and **Monte‑Carlo** stress tests.
    
3. **All MVP Features Exercised** – Parser, Definition Lens, Evidence credibility, Contradiction Pulse, Bridge Lens, Simulation tools, Git‑style fork/PR, Reputation stars, Local‑first hosting—**none** of the Phase 2+ artefacts are required.
    
4. **Auditable Transparency** – Hash‑secured evidence and signed merges create a public ledger that can survive media scrutiny and future legislative audits.
    
5. **Reusable Template** – Any jurisdiction can clone the MIT‑licensed canvas, swap inspection data, and replicate the 10×‑faster decision cycle.
    

**Bottom line:** The MVP alone transforms a tedious, months‑long infrastructure debate into a single‑day, data‑driven sprint, delivering higher safety and public trust without touching controversial policy arenas.
