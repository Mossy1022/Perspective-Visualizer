This scenario assumes **Phase 1 (MVP)** feature set.  
+*Emotion Stream* and *Scenario Dial* appear in **Phase 2** variations.
### Scenario

The UN convenes a multi‑stakeholder debate:

- Governments
    
- NGOs
    
- Private desalination startups
    
- Local communities
    

Goal: decide whether to prioritise large‑scale desalination plants or distributed conservation technologies.

### Step 0 — Import Seed Perspectives

- Each stakeholder fills a quick survey; AI Intent Parser extracts initial criteria (cost, carbon, sovereignty, resilience, equity).
    
- Four seed perspectives appear on the public canvas, each MIT‑licensed.
    

### Step 1 — Bridge Lens Negotiation

- The NGO fork highlights equity concerns with a high negative weight on centralised plants.
    
- The desalination startup fork shows high confidence but low credibility evidence in financing.
    
- Bridge Lens sliders reveal that a five percent cost‑subsidy would align equity within acceptable corridor.
    

### Step 2 — Evidence Audit

- World Bank uploads a peer‑reviewed cost model.
    
- Credibility meter boosts the cost criterion weight; contradiction pulse flags two NGO anecdotes that contradict the model.
    
- The NGO author downgrades their anecdote weight after Explain‑Back Check.
    

### Step 3 — Stress‑Scenario Simulator (MonteCarlo)

- The **Stress‑Scenario Simulator** is toggled to a 1‑in‑100‑year drought
    
- The distributed conservation plan fails in 35 percent of runs; desalination plan fails in 15 percent.
    
- *Consensus Corridor Ribbon* will be explored in a Phase 2 follow‑up exercise.

### Step 4 — Pull Request and Merge

- The hybrid plan is formalised in a pull request to the root perspective.
    
- All groups sign off; the merge commits a new snapshot.
    
- License badge remains MIT, enabling downstream national forks.
    

### Outcome Metrics

- Decision latency dropped from six weeks of debate to nine hours of collaborative analysis
    
- Empathy score: 82 percent of participants could restate the opposing top criterion
    
- Contradiction count resolved: 91 percent
