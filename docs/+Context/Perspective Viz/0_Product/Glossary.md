- **Agent** – person, org, government or bot authoring a perspective.
- **Badge** – small icon conveying license or reputation (Dimension 8).
- **Bridge Lens** – overlay with sliders to find minimum weight shifts for agreement.
- **Confidence Field** – global certainty measure visualized by halo + fog (Dimension 3).
- **Criteria Grid** – heat-map matrix of options × criteria (Dimension 1).
- **Criteria** – an axis against which an option is judged; one column in the Criteria Grid.
- **Drill‑down Snapshot** – A nested **PerspectiveSnapshot** referenced from a WeightCell. Opens as a sub‑grid; rolled‑up via a reducer.
- **Edge** – JSON object capturing causal link (`from`,`to`,`strength`) (Dimension 5).
- **Evidence Layer** – credibility & provenance textures backing each weight (Dimension 2).
- **Explain-Back Check** – guard-rail that blocks save if rationale missing.
- **Fork Lineage** – ribbon showing ahead/behind status across versions (Dimension 7).
- **Governance Badges** – cluster of license + reputation icons (Dimension 8).
- **Kintsugi Overlay** – gold crack texture marking resolved contradictions (Loki - Citadel at The End of Time)
- **Monte-Carlo Panel** – histogram of outcome scores after random perturbations.
- **Loc‑Confidence** – per‑cell certainty value (0‑1) that modulates alpha.
- **Option** – a choice / stance being compared (row header in the grid).
- **Perspective** – a snapshot JSON bundle of weighted reasons bound to an Agent.
- **Simulation Loop** – contradiction pulse → bridge lens → Monte-Carlo → snapshot (Dimension 9).
- **Timeline Thread** – git-style branch view of perspective snapshots (Dimension 6).
- **Weight-Spam Log** – CSV audit of rapid or excessive weight edits.
